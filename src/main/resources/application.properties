# The app should respond to all requests via the root '/enquiries' path, including any additional methods introduced
# by other libraries such as Spring's Actuator which would normally be accessible only from the root '/' path.
# By doing so, the Kubernetes Ingress configuration can map paths to the appropriate backend service such as
# api.domain.co.uk/enquires. If methods are individually prefixed with '/enquiries',
# then methods responding to requests from '/' (i.e. actuator) would be inaccessible from api.domain.co.uk/enquiries.
